# Compsoc Website

@R2ZER0 bucks the trend and doesn't believe in using READMEs (But @neanias is angry about it and did something to help)

*Now back to your regularly-scheduled README!*

## Requirements

* Python 2
  * Pip
  * Virtualenv
* SQLite3

## Setup

Run `./init-dev-env.sh` in a new working environment; this will create a new virtualenv and install the dependencies.
To enter the virtualenv, run `source COMPSOCENV/bin/activate`.

I've been told that @R2ZER0 will actually do something to make it better documented, but I'm bored of waiting for that day, so I've made this. I hope it helps someone. --neanias
